Using R, I implemented various spatial models to account for spatial autocorrelation in economic data. The goal was to improve the accuracy of predictions and uncover spatial patterns that traditional econometric methods may miss. This work can be applied in fields like urban economics, regional development, and real estate analysis, where spatial relationships play a critical role in understanding economic phenomena.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Using advanced visualization techniques to explore relationships between studentsâ€™ characteristics & performance.","tech":["R","tidyverse","advanced vizualization"],"github":"https://github.com/matbarPL/grrrades","youtube":null,"rpubs":"https://rpubs.com/matbarPL/grrrades","external":null},"html":"<p>I created grrrades to visualize and analyze student grades across different courses and semesters. Using R I plot advanced graphics that allows explore grading data. The project aims to provide insights into academic performance, detect trends, and help educators understand how students are performing over time, fostering data-driven decisions in educational settings.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Fast Cart: an efficient cart algorithm for e-commerce","tech":["R","association rules"],"github":"https://github.com/matbarPL/fast-cart","youtube":null,"rpubs":"https://rpubs.com/matbarPL/fast-cart","external":null},"html":"<p>In this project, I developed a fast cart algorithm designed to improve the efficiency of e-commerce systems by optimizing product recommendations and cart management. I utilized R and Shiny to build an interactive web-based interface that demonstrates the performance and capabilities of the cart algorithm. The focus was on creating an algorithm that could efficiently handle large datasets, providing users with real-time, personalized product recommendations.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"IPE clustering and principal component analysis for data exploration","tech":["R","tidyverse","unsupervised learning"],"github":"https://github.com/matbarPL/ipe-clustering-pca","youtube":null,"rpubs":"https://rpubs.com/matbarPL/ipe-clustering-pca","external":null},"html":"<p>In this project, I applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering techniques to explore data from an IPE (International Political Economy) dataset. The goal was to reduce dimensionality and identify patterns within the data using clustering algorithms like k-means. By combining PCA with clustering, I was able to uncover insights and facilitate the analysis of complex data, ultimately enhancing the ability to make data-driven decisions in the IPE field.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Movie ratings thanks to given personality traits","tech":["python","flask","React","JWT","NumPy","sqlite3"],"github":"https://github.com/matbarPL/moviesperstraits","youtube":null,"rpubs":null,"external":null},"html":"<p>In this project, I built a movie recommendation system that uses personality traits to suggest films. I leveraged a personality dataset from Kaggle and employed various technologies like Python, Flask, scikit-learn, React, and JWT to create a user-friendly interface. This allows users to input their personality traits and receive personalized movie recommendations.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Timetable generation using genetic programming","tech":["python","xlsxwriter","xlrd","openpyxl","random"],"github":"https://github.com/matbarPL/Constraint-satisfaction-problem","youtube":null,"rpubs":null,"external":null},"html":"<p>I developed an AI-powered constraint satisfaction problem solver for timetable generation during a student exchange program. The system was designed to accept constraints for teachers and subjects from an Excel file and employed a genetic algorithm to generate optimal timetables that satisfy all the given constraints. The system effectively generates high-quality timetables within a reasonable timeframe, typically within 4.5 seconds.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Approximate functions using C++ and genetic programming","tech":["C++","OOP","STL"],"github":"https://github.com/matbarPL/Genetic-programming","youtube":null,"rpubs":null,"external":null},"html":"<p>The approach involves using non-binary trees to represent expressions in the genetic programming process. I begin by generating an initial population of these expression trees, which are evaluated for their ability to approximate a function of two variables. Through genetic operators such as selection, mutation, and crossover, I iteratively evolve the population toward better solutions. This method leverages the fundamental principles of genetic programming to optimize mathematical expressions efficiently.</p>"}}]}}}
