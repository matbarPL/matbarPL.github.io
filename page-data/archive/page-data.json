The application leverages the Kedro library to streamline data engineering and machine learning pipelines, allowing for efficient model training and retraining. Users can input text, and the application will identify the stance, opinion, and sentiment expressed within the text. The application also includes a user-friendly interface for data visualization and analysis.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-02-06","title":"Recommender System for YELP users","tech":["python","pandas","surprise","keras","scikit-learn","HTML","CSS","JavaScript"],"github":"https://github.com/matbarPL/Recommender-system-for-yelp.com-users","external":null,"company":"WUST","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwbLZ40nag"},"html":"<p>We built a web application to recommend businesses to YELP users, leveraging various algorithms for user selection.  The application allows users to explore recommendations generated by collaborative filtering, neural networks, KNN, and content-based approaches, ultimately delivering the most relevant suggestions based on user preferences and location.  Check out the video below to see the application in action!</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"date":"2018-05-04","title":"What is this fruit?
