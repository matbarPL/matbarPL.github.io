We created a web application to extract opinions from text using natural language processing techniques. The application leverages the Kedro library to streamline data engineering and machine learning pipelines, allowing for efficient model training and retraining. Users can input text, and the application will identify the stance, opinion, and sentiment expressed within the text. The application also includes a user-friendly interface for data visualization and analysis.
