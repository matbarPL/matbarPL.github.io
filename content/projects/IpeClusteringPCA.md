In this project, I applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering techniques to explore data from an IPE (International Political Economy) dataset. The goal was to reduce dimensionality and identify patterns within the data using clustering algorithms like k-means. By combining PCA with clustering, I was able to uncover insights and facilitate the analysis of complex data, ultimately enhancing the ability to make data-driven decisions in the IPE field.
