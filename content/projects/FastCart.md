In this project, I developed a fast cart algorithm designed to improve the efficiency of e-commerce systems by optimizing product recommendations and cart management. I utilized R and Shiny to build an interactive web-based interface that demonstrates the performance and capabilities of the cart algorithm. The focus was on creating an algorithm that could efficiently handle large datasets, providing users with real-time, personalized product recommendations.
