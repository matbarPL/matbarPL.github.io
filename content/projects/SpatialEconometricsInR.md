In this project, I explored spatial econometrics to analyze geospatial data, focusing on spatial dependencies and relationships. Using R, I implemented various spatial models to account for spatial autocorrelation in economic data. The goal was to improve the accuracy of predictions and uncover spatial patterns that traditional econometric methods may miss. This work can be applied in fields like urban economics, regional development, and real estate analysis, where spatial relationships play a critical role in understanding economic phenomena.
