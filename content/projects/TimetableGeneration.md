I developed an AI-powered constraint satisfaction problem solver for timetable generation during a student exchange program. The system was designed to accept constraints for teachers and subjects from an Excel file and employed a genetic algorithm to generate optimal timetables that satisfy all the given constraints. The system effectively generates high-quality timetables within a reasonable timeframe, typically within 4.5 seconds.
