We developed a deep learning application to help identify Vietnamese fruits. By using a convolutional neural network trained on a dataset of fruit images, users can upload pictures of unknown fruits and receive an instant identification. This project was undertaken as part of an academic course and showcases the practical application of deep learning in a real-world scenario.
