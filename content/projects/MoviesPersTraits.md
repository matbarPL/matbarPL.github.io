In this project, I built a movie recommendation system that uses personality traits to suggest films. I leveraged a personality dataset from Kaggle and employed various technologies like Python, Flask, scikit-learn, React, and JWT to create a user-friendly interface. This allows users to input their personality traits and receive personalized movie recommendations.
