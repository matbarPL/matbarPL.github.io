In Portfolio 1.0, I built a foundational website using Hugo. This project marked the beginning of my portfolio development journey and showcased my early skills in creating a dynamic online presence. By leveraging Hugo's framework, I was able to efficiently structure and deploy my website, demonstrating basic understanding of web development principles.
