We built a web application to recommend businesses to YELP users, leveraging various algorithms for user selection.  The application allows users to explore recommendations generated by collaborative filtering, neural networks, KNN, and content-based approaches, ultimately delivering the most relevant suggestions based on user preferences and location.  Check out the video below to see the application in action!
