The approach involves using non-binary trees to represent expressions in the genetic programming process. I begin by generating an initial population of these expression trees, which are evaluated for their ability to approximate a function of two variables. Through genetic operators such as selection, mutation, and crossover, I iteratively evolve the population toward better solutions. This method leverages the fundamental principles of genetic programming to optimize mathematical expressions efficiently.
